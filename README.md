## What git and github are;
Git is a version control system. GitHub uses git. Git is open-source and free. Git keeps track of every change you make in GitHub. GitHub, meanwhile, is where people can share and edit the files they have created. You can also modify these files.

## Why they are used;
It is used so we dont lose our code. we can revert to old changes if needed because the repository will be available. We can also try new changes in files safely. Code can be safely stored online in github. Many people can work on a single project using pull and push command.

## Basic Git Workflow;
 * Intialize/clone a repository: 
   ```sh
   git init #For new git setup
   git clone "repository url" #For exisiting repository
   ```
 * Add files to staging:
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```
 * Commit changes:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Intial Commit"
   ```
 * Connect to remote directory:
   ```sh
   git remote add origin "url"
   ```
 * Push files to repository:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```
## How GitHub helps in team collaboration;
 * Different develoeprs can create their own branches in the same project and work on it remotely and merge safely.
 * Every will have their own copy of the code that thaey can  modify and merge.
 * People can submit changes in the code for review if admin approves it can be merged. Pull request can be used here.
